    "Designed to prepare educators to teach data science, this workshop presents an introductory data science unit for high school students. The unit includes a project plan that guides students through key steps in data investigation: data gathering, processing, exploration, visualization, and storytelling. Participants in the session will learn to help students use Python and libraries like Pandas, Numpy, and Matplotlib to analyze and present data. This session offers practical tools for teaching introductory data science within a structured project framework, and participants will receive resources to help them teach the unit in their own high school classrooms."

It is structured into four milestones, which will be assigned throughout the remainder of the unit. Each milestone will be graded and accompanied by detailed feedback to support your progress.\n",
    "\n",
    "To successfully complete the final project, you will need to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Select a dataset\n",
    "- Develop research questions\n",
    "- Apply data manipulation, generate numerical summaries, and create visualizations\n",
    "- Write a comprehensive report that:\n",

    "  - Answers your research questions\n",
    "  - Reflects on the methods you used\n",

It is important that your chosen dataset aligns with the project requirements and supports the type of analysis you plan to conduct. To ensure this, you’ll need to start by submitting a Dataset Approval Request.\n",

    "- Avoid datasets that:\n",
    "  - Consist entirely of time series data (e.g., stock prices or monthly sales).\n",
    "  - Have repeated measurements spread across rows\n",

    "To help you get started with finding datasets, please review this [document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1anCa86MPIZQDcicwkMT7w2aiHkPOIy5iKffbtxdCQ1o/edit?usp=sharing). If you know of other valuable sources, please share them with me, and I’ll add them to the list.\n",
